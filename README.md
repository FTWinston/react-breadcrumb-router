**Note**: this project has been superceded by [react-router-use-breadcrumbs][8], and is no longer supported.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-breadcrumb-router
```

Note: Version 6 of this package has peer dependencies of `react-router-dom` v6 and `react` v16.8+.
Its only direct dependency is `uuid`.

For react-router v4/v5 support, please use [version 5][7] of this package.

## Usage

This package's `<BreadcrumbRouter>` component should be used in place of the
`<BrowserRouter>` component from `react-router-dom`.

Any component that should generate breadcrumbs should call the `useBreadcrumb` hook.
(Or render a `<Breadcrumb>` component) in its output.

Breadcrumbs are rendered by the `<Breadcrumbs>` component. The single "breadcrumb"
for the current page can be rendered by the `<Title>` component.

See the [`/demo`][3] directory for a complete example.

### Non-display components and hooks

#### BreadcrumbRouter

This component renders a `<BrowserRouter>` along with a react context that
`react-breadcrumb-router` needs in order to function.

#### useBreadcrumb

This hook adds a crumb into the breadcrumb trail. It will be removed again if
the component calling this hook stops rendering.

- `title` (string|component) Text or component to display for this breadcrumb.

The fact that the `title` can be any valid `PropTypes.node` allows for a huge
amount of customization. The following values are all valid:

``` jsx
title: 'Home'
title: <span title="Hovered!">Home</span>
title: <CustomComponent title="Home" icon="house" />
```

#### Breadcrumb

This component simply calls the `useBreadcrumb` hook, without rendering anything.
This allows breadcrumbs to be generated by class components.

### Display components

#### Breadcrumbs

This component displays currently active breadcrumbs. Its various elements use [BEM][6] css classes,
with the root block name set to `breadcrumbs`.

- `className` (string): CSS class to apply to the breadcrumb container.
- `separator` (string|component): Optional content to render between breadcrumbs.
- `includeLast` (bool): Whether the last breadcrumb should be rendered here. Defaults to true, set to false if a `<Title>` component is also being used.
- `rootElement`: (string|component type): Element to use for rendering the breadcrumb container.
- `itemElement`: (string|component type): Element to use for rendering individual breadcrumbs.
  
#### Title

This component displays only the lowest-level breadcrumb that is currently active.

- `className` (string): CSS class to be applied to this element.
- `itemElement`: (string|component type): Element to use for rendering this single item.
