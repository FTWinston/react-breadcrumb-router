# React Breadcrumb Router Demo

This simple demo includes a variety of routes and very basic content to
demonstrate clearly how `react-breadcrumb-router` can easily be integrated into
your application. It is compiled via `webpack` and the following scripts
are available:

- `npm start`: Start a local `webpack-dev-server` to test the site.
- `npm run build`: Build a production version of the demo.
